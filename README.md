1. Added a Style Sheet

Created a new file called "style.css" that controls how everything looks
This is better than putting style information directly in each HTML page
Makes the website easier to update later

2. Better Colors and Layout

Kept your blue color theme but made it look more professional
Added shadows to make things "pop" off the page
Made the website look consistent across all pages

3. Cool Effects When Using the Website

Navigation buttons change color when you hover over them
The logo grows slightly bigger when you hover over it
List items in the Services page move up a bit when hovered

4. Improved Forms

Made the contact form look nicer and easier to use
Added space between form fields
Made the submit button change color when hovered

5. Made the Website Mobile-Friendly

Added rules that change how the site looks on phones
Navigation menu changes to a vertical list on small screens
Content sections adjust to fit different screen sizes

6. Better Organization

Added proper classes to group similar items
Organized the code to be easier to read
Removed duplicate style information
